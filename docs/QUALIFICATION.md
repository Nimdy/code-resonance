# Qualification — what was verified, where, and what was not

All results below come from runs in this repository's `qualification/` harnesses (raw JSON in
`qualification/results/`). Environment: Ubuntu 24.04 on WSL2 (Linux 6.6), Node 22.22, 24 cores, Xvfb; VS Code 1.143.1
(downloaded test instance with isolated profile); Chromium from Playwright 1.62 (headless, software rendering).

## How to run

```bash
cd qualification && npm ci
npx playwright-core install chromium                  # once, if not cached
xvfb-run -a node vscode/run.js                        # real VS Code extension host (+ CR_QUAL_AGENT=claude for a real agent)
CR_QUAL_EXTENSION_REF=<git ref> xvfb-run -a node vscode/run.js   # qualify the extension as of any commit
node browser/stage.qual.js [path-to-a-real-repo]      # Stage in Chromium
node browser/audio.qual.js                            # offline renders, loudness metrics, WAV excerpts
node browser/soak.qual.js                             # long live playback (CR_SOAK_MINUTES)
node session/history-session.js <repo> /tmp/cr-session 120 30   # build a 30-minute real-code session
node session/session.qual.js /tmp/cr-session <projectId>          # render and analyse it
```

The real-agent scenario uses your Claude Code login and is capped with `--max-budget-usd 0.50`.

## VS Code extension host (real)

40/40 checks pass for the current extension (`results/vscode-qualification.json`):

| Area | Verified |
|---|---|
| Install | Packaged VSIX installs through the VS Code CLI (`zerobandwidth.code-resonance`) |
| Consent and baseline | Modal consent once; baseline indexed and not credited as new work |
| Human editing (real keystrokes via the `type` command) | Component, function, import and module-level variable classified; local variable recorded but not credited |
| Files written outside the editor | Observed by the file watcher, classified, attributed `unknown` |
| VS Code file operations | Create, rename, delete |
| Tasks | `npm test` task exit codes 0 then 1 → test passed / failed |
| Terminal (shell integration) | Start/finish with exit code; command text not recorded; `npm test` recognised as a test run |
| Diagnostics | TypeScript errors recorded per file |
| Git | Command-line commit observed with matching hash |
| Real AI agent | Claude Code (Haiku, 9 turns, $0.044): hook events joined the same project; prompt text not persisted; agent-written file observed independently by the extension and attributed to the agent by correlation; the agent's `npm test` counted as a validation (exit 0) |
| Receiver outage | Events queue on disk, drain after restart, nothing lost; per-session order preserved; no duplicates |
| Privacy | Typed text never in the journal (also with content capture off); public endpoints contain no typed text or paths |
| Restart | Capture resumes after a normal VS Code restart without a prompt (see note) |
| Project identity | Hook project ids equal `vscode.Uri.file(root).toString()` hashes for tricky paths |

**Note on restart.** VS Code keeps workspace storage in memory while extension tests run, so persistence cannot be
observed from a test run. The resume check seeds the extension's persisted flag into the real `state.vscdb` and
launches VS Code normally.

**v0.2.0 extension, same suite** (`results/vscode-qualification-v0.2.0-baseline.json`, against the current receiver):
31 pass; terminal `npm test` is not recognised as a test run; no agent integration. The journal for the identical
scripted session was 717 events / 274 KB (v0.2.0) versus 103 events / 38 KB.

**Editor overhead.** Keystroke latency, extension-host event-loop delay and CPU per keystroke were measured with
capture off and on in each run. Differences were below run-to-run noise (CPU per keystroke 0.96–1.35 ms with capture
off across runs; p99 keystroke latency 6–15 ms). The harness types as fast as the editor accepts, so this is a stress
measurement, not typical typing.

## Receiver and interpretation (real code)

Excalidraw (448 files, simulated hour of 300 edits): `GET /api/project` 3 ms (v0.2.0: 308 ms), sort per window 61 ms
(695 ms), `state.json` 7.6 MB (39.8 MB), RSS 312 MB (1007 MB); 300 created symbols for 300 added functions (12,850).

Event → recorded timeline latency (20 events, random window offsets): median 5.1 s, p90 6.3 s, max 6.4 s.

## Browser (Chromium, headless, software rendering)

`results/browser/stage-qualification.json`: live view, measured audio output (no clipping), replay of the full
timeline, scrubbing changes the architecture, WebM recording with audio, WAV export, OBS overlay hides controls and
fills 1920×1080, no file paths in the page, no page errors. Frame rate at 1920×1080 with 1400 nodes (Excalidraw):
Nexus 60, Monolith 60, Nebula 39 fps.

## Audio

`results/audio/audio-qualification.json`: a scripted 3-minute performance rendered offline in every palette.

## 30-minute real-code session

`results/session/session-qualification.json`: Excalidraw's first 120 commits (1–5 January 2020, the app being
built from scratch) replayed as a 30-minute session through the real receiver and worker, then rendered.
Timing is planned and compressed; the code changes are real; there are no test runs or agents in that history.

## Soak

`results/browser/soak-qualification.json`: live Stage with sound while a synthetic session streams events.

## Not verified

- Native Windows and macOS (no Windows Node, and WSL interop is disabled in this environment). VS Code Remote-SSH.
- GPU-accelerated browsers; Firefox and Safari.
- OBS Studio itself (the overlay was verified in Chromium; OBS's CEF and its audio capture were not).
- Human listening and viewing evaluation. Metrics show the audio is clean, varied and responsive; whether it is
  enjoyable for hours needs people to listen.
- Multi-hour real development sessions.
- AI agents other than Claude Code.
